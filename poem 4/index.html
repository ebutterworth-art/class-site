    <h2> a poem by Raymond Carver </h2> <br><br><br><br>

<br>
  <p>

    His name was Tug. Hers,  Margo.

  </p> <br><br><br><br><br><br>

     <br>

    <p>

    Until people, seeing what was happening,<br>
    Began calling her Cargo. </p>

     <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>
    Tug and Cargo. He had drive,<br>
    they said. Lots of hair on his face<br>
    and arms. A big guy. Commanding<br>
    voice. She was more laid-back. A blonde. </p>

     <br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>
    Dreamy. (Sweet and dreamy.) She broke<br>
    loose, finally. Sailed away<br>
    under her own power. Went to places<br>
    pictured in books, and some <br>
    not in any book, or even on the map. </p>

     <br><br><br><br><br><br>


<p>
    Places she, being a girl, and cargo,<br>
    never dreamed of getting to. </p>


    <br><br><br>

    <p>
        Not on her own, anyway. </p>
